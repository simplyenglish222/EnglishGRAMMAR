      <article class="passage" id="p1">
        <p>In 1903 two brothers named Wilbur and Orville Wright sent a letter to government officials in Washington, D.C., announcing a revolutionary invention. They wrote, “The series of experiments upon which we have been engaged for the past five years, has ended in the production of a flying machine…” At the time, however, such an achievement was considered impossible, and their letter and invention were ignored.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the Wright brothers had indeed accomplished the “impossible,” and they had not done it by accident. It was successfully done through years of study, experiment, and hard work.</p>
        <p>The Wright brothers were raised in Ohio, the sons of a bishop in the Church of the United Brethren in Christ. Wilbur was born in 1867; and he and his brother Orville, younger by four years, enjoyed a similarity in spirit and interests which made them a natural team.</p>
        <p>Ever since childhood the brothers had displayed a talent for building things. Their father had encouraged them, urging them to earn money to meet the cost of any project they started. Both brothers were especially interested in mechanical things. This interest, together with their pioneering spirit and gift for original thinking, eventually produced the “impossible” machine—the airplane.</p>
        <p>As two poorly educated young men, the Wright brothers were the first to discover the secret of air travel that had escaped the genius of the world’s greatest scholars for thousands of years. Their earliest contact with the dream of flight came as children when their father brought them a toy helicopter. It was basically a flying top, powered by twisted rubberbands, a crude forerunner of the familiar flying machine that is so useful today. The boys studied the toy, took it apart, and finally discarded it. But the memory of its flying principles stayed with them and sparked their imagination. They began to explore other airborne objects. They watched birds and studied the lifting and drifting of the birds’ wings soaring against the sky. They experimented with kites and set up their own kite-making business for neighborhood children.</p>
        <p>As the brothers grew older, they continued their studies, reading the history of man’s early attempts to fly and reports of recent experiments with gliders being conducted by Otto Lilienthal in Germany and by the Americans, Octave Chanute and Samuel P. Langley. Such studies helped to overcome their lack of formal technical education; but from the start of their experiments, they found that they needed to earn money to pay for their research.</p>
        <p>To earn this money, the brothers in 1892 opened a bicycle shop in Dayton, Ohio. It was a successful enterprise and they were soon marketing a bicycle of their own design, the Van Cleve. But their main interest remained the study of flight. They learned that there were two schools of thought in regard to the possible conquest of the air. First, there were those who believed in gliders that flew like kites. Then, there were those who had experimented with motor machines that imitated birds, even to copying the flapping of their wings.</p>
        <p>The Wrights decided to start their experiments with motorless gliders. They built a crude craft and journeyed to the eastern shore of the United States. They wanted an unpopulated area with soft sand and, more important, steady winds. They wrote to the United States Weather Bureau for advice and were directed to the sand dune region near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. There, late in 1900, the brothers completed their first glider flight with a man aboard. Wilbur was the pilot, proving that only man could glide through the air. The more important question remained unanswered: could man fly through the air?</p>

      <article class="passage" id="p2">
        <p>For three more years the Wrights worked to improve their glider, paying particular attention to its controls and to the shape of the wings. By experimenting with movable portions of the wings, they made important improvements in flight control. Orville then designed an engine which they built and mounted on the glider to produce flying power. They also experimented with various designs for the all-important propellers.</p>
        <p>The strange new craft gradually took shape, first in the Wright brothers’ minds and then physically, as they worked in the yard of their little bicycle shop. At the same time, however, the scientific world was coming to the conclusion that flight in heavier-than-air machines seemed impossible. There had already been many costly failures of powered flight experiments, and scientists were saying that such flights just could not be done.</p>
        <p>Samuel P. Langley of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., had been working on the construction of a man-carrying airplane which he called the Aerodrome. In 1903 he suffered two disastrous failures when he attempted to catapult his plane into the air from a boat on the Potomac River near Washington, D.C. His second unsuccessful attempt had taken place on December 6, 1903.</p>
        <p>The Wright brothers, both now over 30 years old, were not discouraged by these mishaps. Their experiments had taught them the basic principles of flight that trained scientific minds had failed to find. So once again the brothers returned to the sand hills at Kitty Hawk this time in the middle of winter. The date was December 17, 1903.</p>
        <p>Their flying machine, made of pieces of wood and cloth, looked too fragile to fly. With Orville at the controls, the pioneer plane moved down a track, was catapulted into the air, and flew for twelve seconds. It was the first controlled, sustained flight of an airplane. Orville described the flight in the following way:</p>
        <p>“During the night of December 16, 1903, a strong cold wind blew from the north. When we arose on the morning of the 17th, the puddles of water which had been standing about camp since the recent rains, were covered with ice. The wind had a velocity of 22 to 27 miles an hour. We thought it would die down before long, but when 10 o’clock arrived, and the wind was as brisk as ever, we decided that we had better get the machine out.</p>
        <p>“Wilbur, having used his turn in the unsuccessful attempt on the 14th, the right to the first trial now belonged to me. Wilbur ran at the side, holding the wing to balance it on the track. The machine, facing a 27-mile wind, started very slowly. Wilbur was able to stay with it till it lifted from the track after a forty foot run.</p>
        <p>“The course of the flight up and down was exceedingly erratic. The control of the front rudder was difficult. As a result the machine would rise suddenly to about ten feet, and then as suddenly dart for the ground. A sudden dart when a little over 120 feet from the point at which it rose into the air, ended the flight. The flight lasted only 12 seconds, but it was nevertheless the first in the history of the world in which a machine carrying a man had raised itself by its own power into the air in full flight, had sailed forward without reduction of speed, and had finally landed at a point as high as that from which it started.”</p>
        <p>Later in the day, Wilbur made a flight of more than 800 feet and stayed in the air for fifty-nine seconds.</p>

      <article class="passage" id="p3">
        <p>Though they had conquered the air, the Wrights still had to conquer the public's disbelief—the refusal of people to agree that a successful flight had been made. So the brothers returned to Ohio and continued with their experiments, improving their airplane and testing it near their home in Dayton. They sent letter after letter to government officials, but the news of their invention was either ignored or caused only little interest.</p>
        <p>By the end of 1904, they could keep the airplane up for five minutes and fly complete circles. On October 5, 1905, in Dayton, Ohio, they flew 24 miles in 38 minutes—as far and as long as the gasoline supply would allow. Certain that they had the Flyer perfected, the Wright brothers were granted a patent for their invention in 1906. They formed the Wright Company to manufacture aircraft and began at that time to seek a market.</p>
        <p>By 1908 the Wrights had gained worldwide fame. While Wilbur was in France dazzling European audiences with flying demonstrations, Orville was conducting a series of flights before United States government officials at Fort Myer, Virginia. As a result of these demonstrations, the United States purchased its first military aircraft, a Wright machine, for a cost of $25,000, and licenses were granted to firms abroad for the manufacture of the Wright brothers' aircraft.</p>
        <p>Wilbur and Orville never lost their modesty when honors were showered upon them. They paid little attention to the medals and ribbons which they received from scientific societies, and again and again, they refused to make public speeches. Their unwillingness to speak out in public was emphasized by Wilbur when he commented, “I know of only one bird, the parrot, that talks, and the parrot cannot fly very high.”</p>
        <p>For Wilbur there were to be only a few short years of success. In May 1912, at the age of 45, he died of typhoid fever. His death marked the end of one of the greatest inventive partnerships in history.</p>
        <p>Though Orville continued to work in aviation for several years more, his heart was no longer in it. He flew a plane for the last time in 1918. He retired from his company and lived quietly at his home in Dayton.</p>
        <p>Also contributing to Orville's withdrawal from public life was his unhappiness with legal disputes with fellow aviation pioneer Glenn Hammond Curtiss arising over the patent rights which the Wright Company held on aircraft design. He also felt the United States government slighted his and Wilbur's achievements when, in 1914, the Smithsonian Museum placed on display Samuel Langley's Aerodrome, which had been built but not flown in 1903, with the notice that it was the first heavier-than-air-machine “capable” of flight. When later invited by the Smithsonian to place the Kitty Hawk Flyer on display Orville declined and instead sent it to the Science Museum at South Kensington, England.</p>
        <p>In 1943, at the request of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Orville asked that the plane be returned to be put on permanent exhibit at the Smithsonian. Orville, however, never saw the display. On January 30, 1948, he died at the age of 77. The following December 17, exactly 45 years after the first flight, the Flyer was placed on permanent exhibition. A sign on the plane reads:</p>
        <p><b>THE ORIGINAL WRIGHT BROTHERS' AEROPLANE</b><br>
        The world's first power-driven heavier-than-air machine in which man made free, controlled, and sustained flight. Invented and built by Wilbur and Orville Wright, flown by them at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, December 17, 1903.</p>
        <p>By original scientific research the Wright brothers discovered the principles of human flight. As inventors, builders, and flyers they further developed the aeroplane, taught man to fly, and opened the age of aviation.</p>
